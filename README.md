In this project, we aimed to enhance a web page featuring 49 circles, each labeled with the name of an object. Our goal was to create a user-friendly interface that encourages users to click on the circles with the correct names as quickly as possible.

**Key Highlights:**

- **User-Centric Design:** We prioritized the user's experience, incorporating feedback and usability testing to ensure the interface met their needs.

- **Enhanced Interface:** We modernized the design with colors, typography, and layout improvements for a visually pleasing experience.

- **User Engagement:** Interactive elements provided immediate feedback and motivation for users.

- **Speed Challenge:** A timer measured user speed, adding a competitive element to the task.

- **Scoring and Progress Tracking:** We introduced a scoring system for users to track their performance and compete with others.

- **Accessibility:** The interface was made accessible to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities.

- **Responsive Design:** The interface seamlessly adapted to various devices and screen sizes.

- **User Feedback:** Ongoing user feedback drove iterative improvements to the interface.
